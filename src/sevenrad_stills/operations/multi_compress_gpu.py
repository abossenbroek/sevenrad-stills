"""
GPU-accelerated multi-generation compression for compound quality degradation.

NOTE: This operation is fundamentally CPU-bound due to the inherently serial
nature of Huffman encoding in JPEG compression. Following industry standards
(NVIDIA nvJPEG, AMD GPUOpen), we use a hybrid approach:
- CPU (PIL/libjpeg-turbo): JPEG encoding/decoding with Huffman coding
- GPU (Taichi): Reserved for future parallelizable preprocessing operations

This implementation exists for API consistency within GPU-based image processing
pipelines. The iterative nature of multi-compression (iteration N depends on N-1)
combined with serial Huffman encoding makes GPU acceleration impractical, as
GPUâ†”CPU memory transfer overhead would exceed any potential gains.

Performance Characteristics:
- CPU version: Optimal (uses libjpeg-turbo)
- GPU version: Similar to CPU (CPU-bound by Huffman encoding)
- Metal version: Similar to CPU (CPU-bound by Huffman encoding)

For more details on why JPEG encoding remains CPU-bound, see:
