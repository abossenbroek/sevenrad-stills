# sevenrad-stills

**Poetic interpretation of digital media through algorithmic transformation**

---

sevenrad-stills is a Python application for extracting video frames and transforming them through compression, degradation, and creative image processing operations. The project explores digital media materiality through the artistic voices of **Arthur Rimbaud** and **Dominique de Groen**.

## Quick Start

1. **[Installation](installation)** - Set up sevenrad-stills
2. **[Getting Started](getting-started)** - Your first image transformation
3. **[Tutorials](tutorials)** - Hands-on examples with compression and degradr effects

## Features

- Extract frames from YouTube videos at configurable intervals
- Apply compression artifacts (JPEG quality, downscaling, motion blur)
- Create degradation effects (blur, noise, chromatic aberration, sensor artifacts)
- Chain operations in YAML pipelines for complex transformations
- Non-destructive processing with intermediate step preservation

## Artistic Philosophy

> *Clinical, marketing-inspired language and exhaustive repetition offer a critical analysis of late-stage capitalism, ecological crises, and exploitation, creating a bizarre and alienating yet recognizable reality.*

Images are processed non-destructively, tracking transformations through incremental steps. Each operation becomes a layer in the digital palimpsest, revealing the computational structures that construct seeing itself.
