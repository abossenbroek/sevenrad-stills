# About sevenrad-stills

**sevenrad-stills** is a Python application for extracting movies from YouTube, taking stills, and reworking these stills to create unique images as part of a book exploring poetic interpretations of digital media through algorithmic transformation.

## Artistic Vision

The project channels the poetic voices of **Arthur Rimbaud** and **Dominique de Groen** to explore abstraction and digital artifacts in contemporary media.

### Dominique de Groen's Style

> Clinical, marketing-inspired language and exhaustive repetition to offer a critical analysis of late-stage capitalism, ecological crises, and exploitation, creating a bizarre and alienating yet recognizable reality.

## Technical Philosophy

- **Non-destructive editing**: All transformations preserve intermediate steps
- **Deterministic operations**: Same parameters always produce the same results
- **Incremental versioning**: Track every stage of transformation
- **Algorithmic artistry**: Code as creative medium

## Image Aesthetic

Images are edited in **non-destructive mode**, always tracking different steps with incremental filenames. The aesthetic focuses on:

- Abstraction and digital artifacts
- Glitch art and data moshing
- Poetic data visualization
- JPEG compression artifacts as artistic medium
- Degradation as transformation

## Technology Stack

- **Python 3.12+** - Modern Python with strict type checking
- **ffmpeg** - Video extraction and processing
- **Pillow & scikit-image** - Image manipulation
- **yt-dlp** - YouTube download
- **Pydantic** - Configuration validation

## Project Values

- **Code quality**: PEP 8, mypy strict mode, comprehensive testing
- **Documentation**: Google-style docstrings, detailed guides
- **Artistic exploration**: Novel visual outcomes over source integrity
- **Open source**: MIT licensed

## Contributing

This is an artistic research project. Contributions welcome that align with the project's aesthetic and technical values.
