# Tutorial 05: Heavy Saturation Boost
#
# GOAL: Create extremely saturated, surreal colors
#
# WHAT YOU'LL SEE:
# - Hyper-saturated, intense colors
# - Surreal, otherworldly appearance
# - Artistic/abstract aesthetic
#
# FRAMES: 15 (1 second at 15 fps)
# OPERATIONS: 1 (saturation)
# DIFFICULTY: Beginner

# WHAT TO LOOK FOR:
#   - Extreme color intensity
#   - Surreal, hyper-real appearance
#   - Artistic abstraction
#
# TRY EXPERIMENTING:
#   - Try value: 2.0 or higher for even more extreme effect
#   - Combine with compression for glitch art
#   - Add noise for digital artifact aesthetic
