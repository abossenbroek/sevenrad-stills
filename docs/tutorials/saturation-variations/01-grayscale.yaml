# Tutorial 01: Complete Grayscale Conversion
#
# GOAL: Demonstrate complete desaturation to black and white
#
# WHAT YOU'LL SEE:
# - Full black and white conversion
# - Complete removal of all color information
# - Focus on luminance, form, and composition
#
# FRAMES: 15 (1 second at 15 fps)
# OPERATIONS: 1 (saturation)
# DIFFICULTY: Beginner

#
# WHAT TO LOOK FOR:
#   - All color information removed
#   - Pure black and white conversion
#   - Tonal relationships preserved
#
# TRY EXPERIMENTING:
#   - Compare with value: -0.8 for near-grayscale
#   - Combine with noise for film grain effect
#   - Add blur_gaussian for dreamy B&W aesthetic
