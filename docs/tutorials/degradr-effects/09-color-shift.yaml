# Tutorial 9: Color Shift
#
# LEARN: Create chromatic aberration by shifting RGB channels
# TRY: Experiment with horizontal, vertical, and diagonal shifts
# FRAMES: 105 (7 seconds @ 15fps)
#
# This tutorial demonstrates chromatic aberration, an optical lens defect
# where colors don't focus at the same point. You'll see how shifting red
# and blue channels creates color fringing at edges.

      operation: "chromatic_aberration"
      params:
        shift_x: 2  # Minimal horizontal shift - subtle red-cyan fringing
        shift_y: 0

    - name: "shift_diagonal"
      operation: "chromatic_aberration"
      params:
        shift_x: 5  # Moderate diagonal shift - noticeable lens defect
        shift_y: 3

    - name: "shift_strong"
      operation: "chromatic_aberration"
      params:
        shift_x: 10  # Strong diagonal shift - pronounced color separation
        shift_y: -5

# HOW TO RUN:
#   sevenrad pipeline docs/tutorials/degradr-effects/09-color-shift.yaml
#
# WHAT YOU'LL SEE:
#   - Subtle horizontal color fringing on vertical edges
#   - Diagonal color separation creating lens-like artifacts
#   - Strong chromatic aberration with visible RGB separation
#
# NOTE: Green channel stays fixed as reference, red and blue shift
#       in opposite directions to create the fringing effect.
#
# TRY NEXT:
#   - Shift values from -20 to 20 for different intensities
#   - Try shift_y without shift_x for vertical fringing
#   - Combine with blur_circular for vintage lens simulation
#   - Use negative values to reverse the shift direction
