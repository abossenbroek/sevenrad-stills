# Tutorial 5: Soft Glow
#
# LEARN: Create dreamy softness using Gaussian blur
# TRY: Experiment with sigma values to control blur intensity
# FRAMES: 105 (7 seconds @ 15fps)
#
# This tutorial introduces Gaussian blur, a fundamental softening effect
# that creates smooth, dreamy imagery. You'll see how sigma controls the
# blur radius, from subtle glow to strong ethereal effects.

    - name: "glow_subtle"
      operation: "blur_gaussian"
      params:
        sigma: 0.5  # Minimal blur - adds gentle softness without losing detail

    - name: "glow_moderate"
      operation: "blur_gaussian"
      params:
        sigma: 2.0  # Moderate blur - creates noticeable dreamy quality

    - name: "glow_strong"
      operation: "blur_gaussian"
      params:
        sigma: 5.0  # Heavy blur - strong ethereal glow effect

# HOW TO RUN:
#   sevenrad pipeline docs/tutorials/degradr-effects/05-soft-glow.yaml
#
# WHAT YOU'LL SEE:
#   - Subtle softness preserving most details
#   - Moderate dreaminess with reduced sharpness
#   - Strong glow creating ethereal atmosphere
#
# TRY NEXT:
#   - Values between 0.5-10.0 for different intensities
#   - Combine with noise for soft film grain aesthetic
#   - Use with chromatic_aberration for dreamy lens effects
