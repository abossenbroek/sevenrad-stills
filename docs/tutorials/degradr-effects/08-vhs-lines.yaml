# Tutorial 8: VHS Scan Lines
#
# LEARN: Create horizontal and vertical line artifacts using directional noise
# TRY: Compare row vs column modes for different retro effects
# FRAMES: 105 (7 seconds @ 15fps)
#
# This tutorial explores row and column noise modes that create scan line
# artifacts. Row mode produces horizontal VHS-style lines, while column
# mode creates vertical distortions.

# HOW TO RUN:
#   sevenrad pipeline docs/tutorials/degradr-effects/08-vhs-lines.yaml
#
# WHAT YOU'LL SEE:
#   - Gentle horizontal scan lines
#   - Classic VHS tracking artifacts
#   - Heavy degraded tape distortion
#   - Vertical line patterns (column mode)
#
# TRY NEXT:
#   - Switch between 'row' and 'column' modes
#   - Remove 'seed' for animated line noise
#   - Combine with downscale for authentic VHS resolution
#   - Use with motion_blur for VCR playback simulation
