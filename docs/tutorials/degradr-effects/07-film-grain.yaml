# Tutorial 7: Film Grain
#
# LEARN: Add analog film texture using Gaussian noise
# TRY: Find the sweet spot between subtle grain and heavy texture
# FRAMES: 105 (7 seconds @ 15fps)
#
# This tutorial introduces Gaussian noise for creating analog film grain
# effects. You'll learn how small amount values create realistic film
# texture while larger values produce heavily degraded aesthetics.

# HOW TO RUN:
#   sevenrad pipeline docs/tutorials/degradr-effects/07-film-grain.yaml
#
# WHAT YOU'LL SEE:
#   - Fine grain texture resembling 35mm film
#   - Noticeable grain creating analog warmth
#   - Heavy grain with strong vintage degradation
#
# TRY NEXT:
#   - Values 0.01-0.2 to explore grain intensity range
#   - Remove 'seed' parameter for different grain per frame
#   - Combine with blur_gaussian for soft film aesthetic
#   - Use with downscale for lo-fi compressed look
