# Tutorial 6: Dreamy Bokeh
#
# LEARN: Create circular lens bokeh effects with disc-shaped blur
# TRY: Compare circular blur with Gaussian blur for different aesthetics
# FRAMES: 105 (7 seconds @ 15fps)
#
# This tutorial explores circular blur, which creates bokeh-like effects
# similar to camera lenses with circular apertures. The disc-shaped kernel
# produces a different aesthetic than Gaussian blur.

      params:
        radius: 3  # Small circular kernel - gentle lens-like softness

      params:
        radius: 8  # Medium circular kernel - noticeable bokeh effect

# HOW TO RUN:
#   sevenrad pipeline docs/tutorials/degradr-effects/06-dreamy-bokeh.yaml
#
# WHAT YOU'LL SEE:
#   - Subtle circular softening mimicking lens defocus
#   - Moderate bokeh creating dreamy out-of-focus areas
#   - Strong bokeh with pronounced circular blur patterns
#
# TRY NEXT:
#   - Radius values 3-20 for different bokeh strengths
#   - Compare with blur_gaussian (sigma=3) to see the difference
#   - Combine with bayer_filter for digital camera simulation
