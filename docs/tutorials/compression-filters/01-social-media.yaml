# Tutorial 01: Social Media Compression Simulation
#
# GOAL: Simulate how images degrade when shared multiple times across
# social media platforms like WhatsApp, Instagram, or Facebook.
#
# WHAT YOU'LL SEE:
# - Noticeable JPEG blocking patterns (8x8 pixel blocks)
# - Color banding in gradients and smooth areas
# - Loss of fine details and texture
# - Overall "compressed" appearance familiar from social media
#
# FRAMES: 60 (6 seconds at 10 fps)
# OPERATIONS: 1 (multi_compress)
# DIFFICULTY: Beginner

segment:
  start: 192.0    # 3 minutes 12 seconds (3m12s)
  end: 198.0      # 3 minutes 18 seconds (3m18s)
  interval: 0.1   # 10 frames per second = 60 total frames

pipeline:
  steps:
    # Simulate 4 social media sharing cycles
    # Each share applies additional JPEG compression
    - name: "social_media_compression"
      operation: "multi_compress"
      params:
        # 4 iterations = simulating 4 sharing cycles
        # (original → share 1 → share 2 → share 3 → share 4)
        iterations: 4

        # Start at 75% quality (typical for mobile uploads)
        quality_start: 75

        # End at 45% quality (after multiple shares)
        quality_end: 45

        # Linear decay means quality drops evenly each share:
        # Share 1: 75%, Share 2: 65%, Share 3: 55%, Share 4: 45%
        decay: "linear"

        # Heavy chroma subsampling (4:2:0) creates visible 8x8 blocks
        # This is what mobile apps typically use to reduce file size
        subsampling: 2

# HOW TO RUN:

#     └── social_media_compression_*_step00.jpg (60 images)
#
# WHAT TO LOOK FOR:
#   - Check sky areas for color banding
#   - Look for 8x8 pixel block patterns in smooth gradients
#   - Notice loss of fine texture detail
#   - Compare early frames vs. late frames if video has motion
#
# TRY EXPERIMENTING:
#   - Increase iterations to 6-8 for more severe degradation
#   - Change decay to "exponential" for rapid initial quality drop
#   - Adjust quality_end to 30 for heavier artifacts
#   - Try quality_start: 85 for higher initial quality
