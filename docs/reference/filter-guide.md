## JPEG Compression Artifacts

The `compression` operation applies JPEG compression with configurable quality and chroma subsampling to create block artifacts and color banding.

### Parameters

- `quality` (int, 1-100): JPEG quality level
- `subsampling` (int, 0/1/2): Chroma subsampling mode
  - `0` (4:4:4): No subsampling - highest quality
  - `1` (4:2:2): Moderate subsampling
  - `2` (4:2:0): Heavy subsampling - default, creates visible 8x8 blocks
- `optimize` (bool): Apply JPEG optimization (default: true)

### Recommended Ranges

#### Severe Compression Artifacts
*Heavy blocking/tiling, loss of high-frequency detail, color banding*

```yaml
- name: "severe_compression"
  operation: "compression"
  params:
    quality: 5          # Range: 1-15 for severe artifacts
    subsampling: 2      # 4:2:0 for maximum blocking
    optimize: false     # Disable optimization for heavier artifacts
```

**Best for**: Extreme degradation, visible 8x8 pixel blocks throughout

#### Moderate Compression
*Noticeable artifacts, especially in gradients and detailed areas*

```yaml
- name: "moderate_compression"
  operation: "compression"
  params:
    quality: 30         # Range: 16-50 for moderate compression
    subsampling: 2
```

**Best for**: Balanced degradation, some details preserved

#### Subtle Compression
*Mild artifacts, reduced file size with acceptable quality*

```yaml
- name: "subtle_compression"
  operation: "compression"
  params:
    quality: 70         # Range: 51-85 for subtle compression
    subsampling: 1      # 4:2:2 for less aggressive subsampling
```

**Best for**: Realistic compression without heavy artifacts

#### High Quality (Minimal Artifacts)
*Very subtle artifacts, primarily for file size reduction*

```yaml
- name: "high_quality"
  operation: "compression"
  params:
    quality: 95         # Range: 86-100
    subsampling: 0      # 4:4:4 - no chroma subsampling
```

**Best for**: Near-lossless compression

## Combining Effects

Combine multiple operations to achieve complex degradation patterns.

### Example 1: Compressed + Pixelated
*Simulates low-quality webcam or video chat*

```yaml
steps:
  - name: "compress"
    operation: "compression"
    params:
      quality: 20
      subsampling: 2

  - name: "pixelate"
    operation: "downscale"
    params:
      scale: 0.3
      upscale: true
      upscale_method: "nearest"
```

### Example 2: Multi-Gen Compression + Blur
*Simulates heavily degraded, repeatedly shared media*

```yaml
steps:
  - name: "multi_compress"
    operation: "multi_compress"
    params:
      iterations: 7
      quality_start: 60
      quality_end: 15
      decay: "exponential"

  - name: "slight_blur"
    operation: "motion_blur"
    params:
      kernel_size: 3
      angle: 0
```

### Example 3: Complete Degradation Pipeline
*All effects combined for maximum degradation*

```yaml
steps:
  - name: "downscale"
    operation: "downscale"
    params:
      scale: 0.25
      upscale: true
      upscale_method: "nearest"

  - name: "compress"
    operation: "compression"
    params:
      quality: 15
      subsampling: 2

  - name: "blur"
    operation: "motion_blur"
    params:
      kernel_size: 4
      angle: 45

  - name: "final_compress"
    operation: "multi_compress"
    params:
      iterations: 5
      quality_start: 30
      quality_end: 10
      decay: "linear"
```

## Using the Repeat Parameter

The `repeat` parameter allows any operation to be applied multiple times sequentially, creating elegant loops in YAML.

### Basic Repeat Usage

```yaml
- name: "repeated_compression"
  operation: "compression"
  repeat: 5                 # Apply 5 times
  params:
    quality: 50
    subsampling: 2
```

**Effect**: Simulates 5 save/load cycles at the same quality level.

### Repeat vs. Multi-Compress

- **`repeat` with `compression`**: Each iteration uses the same parameters
- **`multi_compress`**: Supports quality decay curves across iterations

Use `repeat` when you want consistent degradation each cycle. Use `multi_compress` when you want progressive quality reduction.

### Advanced Repeat Examples

#### Repeated Downscaling
*Progressive resolution loss*

```yaml
- name: "cascade_downscale"
  operation: "downscale"
  repeat: 3
  params:
    scale: 0.8              # Each iteration: 80% of previous size
    upscale: false
```

#### Repeated Blur + Compression
*Combine repeat on multiple steps*

```yaml
steps:
  - name: "blur_cycle"
    operation: "motion_blur"
    repeat: 3
    params:
      kernel_size: 2
      angle: 0

  - name: "compress_cycle"
    operation: "compression"
    repeat: 4
    params:
      quality: 40
      subsampling: 2
```

  interval: 1.0

steps:
  - name: "social_media_compression"
    operation: "multi_compress"
    params:
      iterations: 4                 # Simulates 4 share cycles
      quality_start: 75             # First share at 75% quality
      quality_end: 45               # Final share at 45% quality
      decay: "linear"               # Consistent quality drop each share
      subsampling: 2                # Heavy subsampling for mobile compression

output:
  base_dir: "output/social_media"
  final_dir: "output/social_media/final"

```

**Expected result**: Large pixel blocks in windows and street furniture, heavy JPEG blocking, structural elements still recognizable but heavily abstracted.

## Using Repeat for Flexible Sequences

The `repeat` parameter provides elegant control over how many times an operation is applied, making it easy to create complex degradation sequences.

### Repeat Parameter Benefits

1. **Cleaner YAML**: No need to duplicate operation steps
2. **Consistent Parameters**: Same settings applied multiple times
3. **Range**: 1-100 repetitions supported per step
4. **Deterministic**: Always produces the same result with same parameters

### Example: Comparing Repeat vs. Multi-Compress

**Using repeat with standard compression**:
```yaml
- name: "repeated_compression"
  operation: "compression"
  repeat: 5
  params:
    quality: 50                     # Same quality each iteration
    subsampling: 2
```

**Using multi-compress with decay**:
```yaml
- name: "decaying_compression"
  operation: "multi_compress"
  params:
    iterations: 5
    quality_start: 50               # Starts at 50
    quality_end: 30                 # Ends at 30
    decay: "linear"                 # Progressive decay
```

**When to use each**:
- Use `repeat` for consistent, cumulative degradation
- Use `multi_compress` for progressive quality reduction with decay curves

## Notes on Non-Destructive Editing

All operations in this pipeline maintain incremental filenames to preserve the workflow history:

- Each step saves output with a unique name: `{step_name}_{frame_stem}_step{index:02d}.jpg`
- Intermediate results are saved to `intermediate_dir`
- Final results are saved to `final_dir`
- Original frames are never modified

This allows you to review each stage of degradation and adjust parameters as needed.
