# [EPIC-007] Polish & User Experience

## Context
Final polish phase for the macOS Swift UI drum machine. This epic focuses on animations, keyboard navigation, tooltips, and error messaging to create a professional, accessible user experience. This is the last implementation phase before production readiness.

## User Story
As a user,
I want smooth animations, keyboard shortcuts, and helpful guidance,
So that the app feels polished, professional, and easy to navigate.

## Scope
- Smooth UI animations for all interactions
- Complete keyboard navigation system
- Comprehensive tooltips and help text
- Clear, actionable error messages
- Empty states and first-run onboarding
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- Progress indicators for long operations

Out of scope:
- Major feature additions
- Performance optimization beyond animation smoothness
- Internationalization/localization (structure only, no translations)
- Advanced accessibility (full screen reader support beyond WCAG 2.1 AA)

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All UI interactions have smooth, consistent animations at 60fps
- [ ] App is fully navigable using keyboard alone
- [ ] All UI elements have descriptive tooltips with keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Error messages provide clear next steps
- [ ] Empty states guide users on first launch
- [ ] All color contrast and touch targets meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- [ ] Long operations show progress with time estimates
