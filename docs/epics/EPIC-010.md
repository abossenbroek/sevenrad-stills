# [EPIC-010] Advanced Parameter Controls

## Context
Users need RYTM-inspired advanced controls to create complex, evolving visual effects. The current parameter system supports basic value adjustments, but lacks the sophisticated modulation capabilities required for generative workflows. This epic introduces conditional processing, parameter ramping, and a prominent REPEAT control to enable technical artists to build intricate effect patterns without manual keyframing.

## User Story
As a technical artist,
I want advanced parameter controls like conditional processing and parameter ramping,
So that I can create complex, evolving visual effects without manually keyframing.

## Scope
- Large REPEAT rotary control (1-100 range) with quick preset buttons and keyboard entry
- Conditional processing UI (every Nth frame, probability-based application)
- Parameter ramping system (start/end values with curve selection)
- Backend support for conditional effect execution and ramp interpolation
- Visual feedback showing which frames will receive effects

Out of scope:
- Audio-reactive parameters (frequency-based modulation)
- External MIDI control for real-time parameter manipulation
- LFO modulation (periodic waveforms)
- Machine learning-based parameter evolution
- Multi-parameter constraint systems

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Users can set REPEAT count from 1-100 using rotary dial, presets, or keyboard input
- [ ] Effects can be conditionally applied (every Nth frame, probability-based)
- [ ] Parameters can ramp across frames with selectable curves (linear, exponential, s-curve)
- [ ] Backend correctly processes trig conditions and calculates ramped parameter values
- [ ] Visual indicators show which frames will be affected by conditional processing
- [ ] YAML schema supports conditional processing and parameter ramping
