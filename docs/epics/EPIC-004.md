# [EPIC-004] History Panel & Undo/Redo

## Context
Users need Photoshop-style history with time-travel capabilities to experiment with effect combinations without fear of losing work. This enables non-destructive exploration of the audio processing pipeline by allowing restoration to any previous state and supports branching when changes are made after navigating backward in time.

**Architecture Decision**: This epic uses Command Pattern with replay-based undo. Commands store minimal deltas, NOT full state snapshots. Undo works by: reset pipeline + replay commands[0:index-1].

## User Story
As a drum machine user,
I want to see all my actions in a history panel and travel back to any previous state,
So that I can experiment freely and recover from mistakes without manually recreating configurations.

## Scope
- Command pattern infrastructure for all pipeline modifications
- History state manager with undo/redo capability
- Visual history panel showing all executed commands
- Keyboard shortcuts for undo (Cmd+Z) and redo (Cmd+Shift+Z)
- Time-travel functionality with branching behavior
- Lightweight state storage (pipeline configuration, not audio data)

Out of scope:
- Persistent history across app sessions
- Named snapshots or bookmarks
- History diff visualization
- Collaborative editing with shared history

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All pipeline modifications are captured as commands
- [ ] Users can click any history state to restore that configuration
- [ ] Undo/redo keyboard shortcuts work correctly
- [ ] Making changes after time-travel discards future states with notification
- [ ] History panel displays command descriptions with current state indicator
- [ ] State restoration triggers automatic preview re-render via observation
