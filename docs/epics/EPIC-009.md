# [EPIC-009] Scene Preset System

## Context
RYTM-inspired scene management enables technical artists to save and recall complete effect chain configurations instantly. Scenes function as presets, storing the entire pipeline state (effects, parameters, repeat counts) for quick switching between visual styles without manual reconstruction.

## User Story
As a technical artist,
I want to save and load preset effect chains,
So that I can quickly switch between different visual styles without manually rebuilding pipelines.

## Scope
- Scene slot UI with 12 scenes (A-L) in RYTM-style layout
- Scene save operation capturing full pipeline state to YAML
- Scene load operation restoring pipeline from YAML
- Scene management operations (rename, clear, duplicate, import/export)
- Bank switching mechanism (6 visible scenes at a time: A-F or G-L)
- Scene comparison view for A/B analysis

Out of scope:
- Scene morphing or interpolation between scenes
- Automated scene changes or triggers
- Timeline-based scene sequencing
- Scene randomization or generative variations
- Audio-reactive scene switching

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Users can save current pipeline to any of 12 scene slots
- [ ] Users can recall any saved scene to restore complete pipeline state
- [ ] Scene UI shows 6 slots at a time with bank toggle for slots 7-12
- [ ] Scene comparison view highlights differences between two scenes
- [ ] Scenes persist as YAML files in session directory
- [ ] Scene operations integrate with undo/redo system
